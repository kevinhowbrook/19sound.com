If using Method 1, this folder is where the output from the compiled LESS files
should be generated. If using the LESS module, this folder can be ignored or
removed.

If using Method 2, edit the style.css file to your liking.


!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!
===========================
DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE LESS IS NOT BEING USED --- 
YOU WILL POTENTILLY LOSE YOUR CHANGES IS SOMEONE ELSE USES LESS!!!

Install a LESS compiler app:
MAC:	http://incident57.com/less/ 
WINDOWS: http://winless.org/ or http://wearekiss.com/simpless
and compile locally from the files in MYtheme/less.

Choose MYtheme/css/  as output folder.

If in doubt, you can still write raw CSS, but make sure it's written in the LESS files NOT directly into output css files, as this will likely cause LESS/CSS out of sync issues.
