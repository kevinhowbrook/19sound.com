# NDP - B-Lazy #

B-Lazy module - built for use with NDP Cards feature, but could be used for any blazy implementation you want. Requires setting field name in module currently.

See http://dinbror.dk/blazy for info on the b-lazy js plugin.

### TODO ###

* We should just build out a full display formatter module for this functionality. This would allow a user to select an image, then as its display formatter assign the blazy data-src attributes. Would be based on the css formatter module.
