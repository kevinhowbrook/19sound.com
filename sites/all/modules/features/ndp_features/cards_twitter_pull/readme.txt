NDP Twitter Pull Card
==========================

About
--------------------------

This will give you a card for the NDP Card feature. You MUST enable the twitter module settings to get this to work.

* Create a new twitter app on your twitter account develop page - (use the clients twitter account if possible)
* Go to the twitter module settings.
* You can disable the views and download tweets options - we dont need that for this card
* Add in the api key and secret
* Add a single global account using the sign on button (this account has to be present to make the api connection work)
* Only enable the 'global' option - nothing else is needed

You should now be able to drop in a hashtag or twitter name, or just search term as the twitkey on the Twitter Pull card and it should work.
